Touchy
======

by Matthew Scharley
a plugin for [Redcar][1]

## Description

Adds a "Touch file" option to the project plugin's context menu.

## Reason for being

I got sick of typing touch commands to tell [mod_passenger][2] that I wanted it
to reload it's files.

## Installation

TBC

## Problems

* Irc at #redcar on irc.freenode.net. I'm known by `monoxide` on Freenode.
* Issue queue at http://github.com/mscharley/touchy/issues
