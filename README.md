Touchy
======

by Matthew Scharley  
a plugin for [Redcar](http://redcareditor.com/)

## Description

Adds a "Touch file" option to the project plugin's context menu.

## Reason for being

I got sick of typing touch commands to tell 
[mod_passenger](http://www.modrails.com/) that I wanted it to reload 
it's files.

## Installation

    $ mkdir -p ~/.redcar/plugins
    $ cd ~/.redcar/plugins
    $ git clone git://github.com/mscharley/touchy.git

## Problems

* Irc at #redcar on irc.freenode.net. I'm known by `monoxide` on Freenode.
* [Issue queue](http://github.com/mscharley/touchy/issues)
